= Kicad OSX Builder
this is a build system to make universal OSX kicad binaries with scripting support,
it packs wxpython and pcbnew plugins together into kicad.app, and wraps all kicad apps
to use the libraries in there.

It's my first experiencie packaging Mac OSX apps, so it can be done better for sure,
it works anyway ;)
